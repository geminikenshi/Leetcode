# 49. Group Anagrams

## thought process

- same character frequency == Anagram
- scan each string for its character frequency

problem:

```go
func groupAnagrams(strs []string) [][]string {

}
```

Sudo code

```go
declare []frequency
declare ans [][]string

scan []strs{
    scan str{
        get character frequency


    }
         for i,v range []frequency{


        if   //  frequency in []frequency
        {
            append str in []string at ans[i]

        }
        else // (this frequency is new)   // not in the []frequency
        {
            append frequency in the slice

            append this str as new []string in ans
        }
         }

}

```
